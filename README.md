# spotify-login
## I used this project as an opportunity to learn Selenium and build something cool. Now I know how web sutoamtion works. 
To run, set up Selenium on your browser, set playlists equal to an list of urls as strings of playlists/albums you want to play. Replace "your username" and "your password" as appropriate.
